Kai is a sweet girl with a heartwarming and loving personality. She loves spending time with other dogs and we would love for her to go to a home with at least one other dog. She loves toys and snuggles, and while she can be a little shy at first, she opens up quickly and is the best companion. This little ball of sunshine is an amazing addition for any family.

She was born 3/10/24 and weighs just under 40 lbs right now, so we don't expect her to get too big. She comes from a beautiful pocket pittie, shepherd, lab mom and a labradoodle dad, so she's a wonderful mix of many breeds. If you're looking for a little ball of love to add to your family, look no further!
