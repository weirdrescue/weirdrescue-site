Gemma is a confident, playful, and affectionate Labrador Retriever × Pit Bull Terrier mix with loads of personality. She will happily strut on a leash like it’s a runway, happily play a bit of chase or puzzle game, and then plop down for a snuggle on demand. She’s house-trained, goofy, and ready for her next chapter — starring you. She also has the cutest habit of constantly carrying a stuffie with her everywhere she goes (check the video for proof)!
