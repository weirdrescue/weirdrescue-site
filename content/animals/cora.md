Cora is a beautiful, sweet-natured young cat with a curious heart and a mind of her own. She’s a little shy with people at first and prefers affection on her terms—but once she feels safe, she’ll follow you from room to room, curl up next to you on the couch, and even lay right on top of you while you sleep (just don’t expect too many pets!).

She’s incredibly food-motivated and has already started learning fun tricks like sit and high-five. She’d thrive in a home with another playful, confident cat to help bring out her spunky side.

Cora also has a passion for plants—so much so that she’ll happily “prune” them for you. Plant lovers, be prepared to keep your greenery safely out of reach.

She’s spayed, vaccinated, and ready for her forever home—a place that will celebrate her independence, her sweetness, and her wonderfully weird little ways.
