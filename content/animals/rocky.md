Meet Rocky, a tiny ball of energy with a big personality to match. This playful, curious kitten is always on the move, chasing adventures (and sometimes dogs-yes, he loves playing tag with them!). Rocky adores attention, and once he decides it's cuddle time, he'll turn on his purr motor and snuggle right in. He's fascinated by the kitchen and can often be found supervising dinner prep like a very serious (and adorable) sous-chef. Not afraid of water one bit, Rocky happily keeps you company while you brush your teeth, helps "inspect" dog bath time, and may even tolerate a quick sponge bath if he's feeling cooperative. Slim but mighty, he has a healthy appetite to match his big spirit. When the zoomies strike, expect joyful laps around the living room and impressive climbs up the kitty condo. Rocky is a fun-loving, affectionate little guy who's ready to bring the nonstop laughs and love into his forever home.
